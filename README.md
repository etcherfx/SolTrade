## Features üìÇ

- **Custom strategies**: Create your own trading strategies and use them with SolTrade. Customize parameters like `stoploss`, `trailing_stoploss`, `takeprofit`, etc to fit your needs
- **Multiple token trading**: Instead of waiting for one token to meet trading conditions, you can analyze multiple tokens to increase trade chances, given you have a good RPC and self-hosted or paid Jupiter API.

- **Primary Mint**: The token you want to trade with, usually a stablecoin like USDC
- **Secondary Mint**: The token you want to trade for, like SOL or any other Solana token
- **Trading Intervals**: The time interval between each technical analysis (whether current conditions are fit to trade), in minutes
- **Price Update Interval**: The time interval between each price update, in seconds
- **Max Slippage**: The maximum percentage difference between the expected price and the executed price when making a trade
- **Strategy**: The trading strategy you want to use, like `default` or your own custom strategy

## Setup üîß

- Sign up for a [CryptoCompare API key](https://www.cryptocompare.com/cryptopian/api-keys)
- Create a new wallet on [Phantom](https://phantom.app/) or any other Solana wallet solely for SolTrade
- Deposit however much of the primary token you want to trade with into your wallet and at least `~0.1 $SOL` to cover transaction fees

## Installation üõ†Ô∏è

- Set Windows PowerShell execution policy to `RemoteSigned`:
  ```
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```
- Install `poetry` via `pip`:
  ```
  pip install poetry
  ```
- Set poetry to create virtual environments in the project directory:
  ```
  poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
  ```
- Go into the project root directory and nstall the dependencies:
  ```
  poetry install
  ```
- Install the poetry shell plugin:
  ```
  poetry self add poetry-plugin-shell
  ```

## Usage üöÄ

- Enter the virtual environment:
  ```
  poetry shell
  ```
- Start the bot:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```

## Custom Strategies üìà

> [!NOTE]  
> `{Your Strategy Name}` is just a placeholder for your strategy name. Replace it with your actual strategy name without the `{}`.

- Create a new Python file in the `strategies` directory named `{Your Strategy Name}_strategy.py`
- Create a class named `{Your Strategy Name}Strategy` (all one word with the first letter being a capital letter) that inherits from the `BaseStrategy` class
- Create a `__init__` method that takes in the following parameters:
  ```
  def __init__(self, df: pd.DataFrame):
    self.df = df
    self.stoploss =
    self.takeprofit =
    self.trailing_stoploss =
    self.trailing_stoploss_target =
  ```
- Create a `apply_strategy` method that is called by the bot to apply the strategy:
  ```
  def apply_strategy(self):
    if config().strategy == "{Your Strategy Name}":
      # Your strategy logic here
  ```
- Then, change the config `strategy` parameter to `{Your Strategy Name}`
- Lastly, feel free to make a pull request to add your strategy to the main project
